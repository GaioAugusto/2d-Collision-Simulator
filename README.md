# **2D Collision Simulator**

A 2D physics simulation that demonstrates elastic collisions between balls. The project features an interactive GUI with controls to adjust the simulation's parameters.

---

## **Overview**

The **2D Collision Simulator** is a simple interactive program built with **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). Users can:

- Adjust the velocity of the balls.
- Add or remove balls from the simulation.
- Analyze elastic collisions.

Purpose:

- Practice C++ and OOP concepts
- Basic physics simulations.
- GUI design.
- Using the SFML library.
