# **2D Collision Simulator**

A visually appealing 2D physics simulation that demonstrates elastic collisions between balls within a confined window. The project features an interactive GUI with controls to adjust the simulation's parameters.

---

## **Overview**

The **2D Collision Simulator** is a simple interactive program built with **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). Users can:

- Adjust the velocity of the balls.
- Add or remove balls from the simulation.
- Observe realistic elastic collisions between balls.

This project serves as an excellent introduction to:

- Basic physics simulations.
- GUI design.
- Using the SFML library.

## **Features**

### **Physics Simulation**

- Balls move with velocity and bounce off each other and window boundaries.
- Realistic elastic collision handling.

### **Interactive Buttons**

- **Increase/Decrease Velocity:** Modify the speed of the balls.
- **Add/Remove Balls:** Dynamically change the number of balls in the simulation.

### **User-Friendly Design**

- Buttons with hover effects.
- Main menu with a "Start" button to initialize the simulation.
